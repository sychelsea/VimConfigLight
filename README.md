# Zsh Configuration
- Change the path to your oh-my-zsh installation in line 8. 
- The last two lines is used to bind HOME and END keys. If your keys works well. Delete these two lines.
- The theme of zsh makes it looks like a default ubuntu bash with extra git information. 

# Tmux Configuration
## Custom Hotkeys
Mouse is enabled. You can use mouse to swith tab and tune the size of windows.
I add som custom hotkeys. Here are the main difference:
- ```Ctrl t```: Tmux function prefix ***(How to remember: 't' is the first letter of tmux!)***
  The following hotkeys should follow the tmux leader ```Ctrl t```
- ```\```: Split the window vertically ***(You don't need to press SHIFT compared to the default setting)***
- ```-```: Split the wimdow horizontally
- ```n```: New tab
- ```t```: Switch bwtween tabs. You can press ```t``` multiple times continuously. 
There may be some other custom hotkeys. You can check the comments in '.tmux.config' for more infomation.
